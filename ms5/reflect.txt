Throughout the development of the "General Healthcare Facility Pre-Triage Application,"
I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++.
I learned how to effectively use classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world
entities such as patients and healthcare facilities.

This project enabled me to grasp the importance of encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism in building modular and extensible software systems. Additionally, I
acquired proficiency in managing dynamic memory allocation and resource management
using constructors, destructors, and smart pointers, which are essential aspects of
C++ programming.

One of the significant challenges I faced during the development process was
designing and implementing a robust data management system for patient records while
adhering to object-oriented principles.

Comparing to the previous C workshop, I found that managing code with C++ class based
apporach is more flexible and code is more maintainable too. There were few obstacles
I faced while completing the milestones like working with virtual functions, and mostly
template functions, for which i used `geeksforgeeks` to get description. For the milestone 3,
on time module, I asked for my professor and great thanks to him that he helped me solve my 
problem so easily. 

Overall, moving from C ( functional based ) to C++ ( object oriented based ) approach,
I learnt a better way to manage my future projects. This whole journey taught me lots of
useful concepts.
